I created this single web page application with react and react-bootstrap. I used as a source data.js file and I manipulated dom with that datas. For that I used STATE and PROPS. My aim was searching with inbox-text element and I write just a couple of code blockes with FILTER method. Actually I didnt interested with styling more because just I focused the functionality.
